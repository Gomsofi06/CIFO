# CIFO project

Project for the Computer Inteligence for Optimization course of the Master in Data Science at the NOVA IMS Faculty, Lisbon

Made in collaboration between **Sofia Gomes**, **Marta Boavida**, **David Cascão** and **Jan-Louis Schneider**

## Objective of the Project:
The‬‭ goal‬‭ is‬‭ to‬‭ maximize‬‭ the‬‭ overall‬‭ relationship‬‭ score‬‭ by‬‭ optimizing‬‭ guest‬‭ seatings‬‭ within‬ each table and then aggregating these scores across all tables.‬
‭
## Dataset:
You‬‭ can‬‭ find‬‭ a‬‭ pairwise‬‭ relationship‬‭ matrix‬‭ of‬‭ all‬‭ 64‬‭ attendees‬‭ ,‬‭ who‬‭ need‬‭ to‬‭ be‬ distributed‬‭ across‬‭ 8‬‭ tables‬‭ .‬‭ You‬‭ can‬‭ also‬‭ consult‬‭ the‬‭ chart‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ guests‬‭ and‬‭ their‬ relationships, as well as a‬‭ table‬‭ explaining relationship‬‭ values.‬
