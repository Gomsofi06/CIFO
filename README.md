# CIFO project

Project for the Computer Inteligence for Optimization course of the Master in Data Science at the NOVA IMS Faculty, Lisbon

Made in collaboration between **Sofia Gomes**, **Marta Boavida**, **David Casc√£o** and **Jan-Louis Schneider**

## Objective of the Project

This project applies a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Wedding Seating Optimization problem. The objective is to maximize the total relationship score between guests by optimizing how they are seated across tables, while ensuring all seating constraints are respected.
